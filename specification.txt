Section 0. Handshake

The server and client must have initiated a handshake before data is sent. Please handshake with this packet.

0;

Using packet id 0 will cause the server to store the IP for sending, and will send packet id 0 back to the client.

If the client gets the packet sent back to it, the handshake is complete!

Section 1. Graphics

For the server to send graphics, the server must have implemented OpenGL into their application.

*!*THE PROTOCOL WILL NOT WORK WITHOUT OPENGL*!*

Before you call any OpenGL function in your application, send this packet to the client.
