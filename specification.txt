Section 0. Specifics

The Networked Video Device client is run on port 4812. All packets are sent on this port.

Section 1. Handshake

The server and client must have initiated a handshake before data is sent. Please handshake with this packet.

0;

Using packet id 0 will cause the server to store the IP for sending, and will send packet id 0 back to the client.

If the client gets the packet sent back to it, the handshake is complete!

Section 2. Graphics

For the server to send graphics, the server must have implemented OpenGL into their application.

*!*THE PROTOCOL WILL NOT WORK WITHOUT OPENGL*!*

Before you call any OpenGL function in your application, send this packet to the client.

1;function(vars)

Where function is the function being called, and vars is a list of variables, seperated by commas.

Section 3. Input

Input is handled by the client. The client sends the packets when a key or other button is pressed. For mice keys, it is like this

2;h,x,y

Where h is either l, r, or m, corresponding to the mouse buttons.
x is the x pixel on the screen where the button is pressed.
y is the y pixel.

Keyboard is handled in a similar way.

3;c

Where c is the keyboard button that is pressed, like "b".

Section 4. Audio

To use audio, you have to send a packet containing the data of the .ogg file you would like to play on the client.
This is the only packet that is bigger than 255 bytes.

4;i,data
Where i is a unique identifier for the sound.
data is the contents of the ogg file.

The file will be cached with the unique id. To play the sound, do

5;i,p,s,v

i = id
p = pitch (0 to 2)
s = speed (0 to 2)
v = volume (0 to 2)
